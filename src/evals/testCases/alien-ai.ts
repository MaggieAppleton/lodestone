	text: "AI insiders refer to language models as 'aliens'. We don't have the language to talk about our new relationships to language models. They are a new kind of otherness. 'Alien' is the most common description people are using for AI systems. Which seems like an ill-fitting frame. By alien we're trying to say 'otherness' or 'thing we can be in relationship with.' It doesn't require vast degrees of consciousness for this. We can have a relationship with a river or a hummingbird. We have always struggled to understand non-human beings. We're bad at companion species. At least in our current cultural context we are bad at systems thinking and interconnected relationships. Not all cultures are bad at it. And we are very bad at recognising and dealing with non-human otherness. We grant rivers and mountains 'personhood' in order to legally protect them from harm.  Philosopher Yuk Hui created the concept of Cosmotechnics to describe how technologies are always embedded in the cosmologies of the cultures that create them Cosmologies are 'the unification of the cosmos and the moral through technical activities, whether craft-making or art-making' (Yuk Hui). Conceiving of AI as kin, intertwined in our ecologies, gives them a relationship to plants, animals, and the earth. Many rivers, mountains, and nature reserves have been given legal personhood. In 2014, the Te Urewera park, the ancestral home of the Tuhoe people, became the first natural feature in the country to be recognised as a legal person. In 2018, Colombia’s Supreme Court granted the Amazon—the world’s largest river—legal rights. Granting rivers legal personhood represents a seismic shift from the bedrock belief in Western society that humans are at the apex of the natural world. But for many Indigenous people, the concept of nature as a sentient equal to humans is nothing new. In Maori culture, for example, ancestors, or tupuna, are embodied in the landscape.' If we don't think of AI's as humans or conscious others like aliens, what other metaphors could we explore? They seem too unlike  our standard machines. Kate Darling proposes animals as a fitting metaphor in her book The New Breed",
