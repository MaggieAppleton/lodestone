	text: "I'm interested in the recent tipping point we've hit where voice-to-text technologies are far more accurate and cheaper than ever before. I have a theory that this is going to lead to a shift in how most people input into their computers. We're all so used to being keyboard people. Everyone is trained that typing is the obvious and default way to interact with your computer. But the combination of voice-to-text technologies like whisper and the advent of large language models mean it could be faster, easier and lower friction for all of us to actually be using voice as our primary input method. We speak differently than we write. More informally and more verbosely. Many people are too formal when they write. And would benefit from working off a transcription where they're more casual and free-flowing. Many of the things people dislike about voice input are because of the way their interaction with voice is designed, rather than voice input itself. For example, they can't see the words they're speaking being output live. Apple's native TTS does this, but whisper currently can't. This means you can't react to what you've just written in the way can with text. One study found finds Whisper transcriptions being used in medical contexts to capture patient consultations have very high error rates. Both mishearing people's words, and blatant hallucinations. Not everyone likes to use voice. E.g. Some people on the autism spectrum prefer not to use voice. There's a deep discussion to be had around the thinking and writing process, and how voice input is/is not part of that.One major consideration I need to think through is the fact that talking out loud is actually inconvenient or disruptive in some contexts, such as shared offices. So not everyone is in a situation where they're able to use voice as their primary input method. Technologies that allow us to speak silently or mouth the words and have an image model read our lips could be possible solutions to this.",
